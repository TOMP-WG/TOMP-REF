# Reference implementation TOMP API

## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

The spring application can be started as MP or as TO, dependend on the supplied profile.<br>

## MaaS Provider
The MaaS Provider can start this application using this profile: -Dspring.profiles.active=maasprovider<br>
This means you can start the MaaS Provider like this: _java -jar reference-[version]-exec.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=maasprovider_<br>

The MaaS component will start at port 8090. This means you can call the API using http://localhost:8090/{localPath}

The MaaS Provider implements also the TOMP API. This means we (mis)used the API also for communicating between an app and the backend of the MaaS Provider. 

Before calling the MaaS component, you'll have to start the TO components (have a look at the application.yml). Default it's car and bike.

e.g. calling POST http://localhost:8090/planning-options/ with body 
<pre>{
  "start-time": 1546336800,
  "end-time": 1546337000,
  "from": {
    "lng": 6.169639,
    "lat": 52.253279
  },
  "radius": 10,
  "to": {
    "lng": 4.897934,
    "lat": 52.362941
  },
  "travellers": 1,
  "provide-ids": true,
  "users": [
    {
      "age": 20
    }
  ]
}</pre>
will result in a few planning options. There is a very simple implementation, dividing the route in a few legs and for each leg it will look for TOs that can fulfill the request. 

## Meta lookup
There is a seperate project with a meta lookup webservice. It contains the available TOs and MPs. It's modifiable in 'operators.json'.

## Operators
These operators are available:<br>
java -jar reference-[version]-exec.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=bike<br>
java -jar reference-[version]-exec.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=car<br>

There are also other possibilities to start up other operators, look at the application.yml. 

If you want to add extra functionality to a (new) operator, please make another provider class for that TO in each module.

## Front end
There is no front end yet. The front end to develop can use the endpoints from the TOMP API to access the information. This way you can also test TO component.

## Example calls
The {id} is produced by the example planning call. All the components don't persist data, so restarting them requires new calls.

### MaaS
_POST_ http://localhost:8090/bookings/
<pre>{
  "id": "{id}",
  "customer": {
    "id": "A0-123456",
    "first-name": "John",
    "last-name": "Doe",
    "phone": "string"
  }
}</pre>


_GET_ http://localhost:8090/operator/information

_POST_ http://localhost:8090/legs/{id}/events
<pre>{
  "time": 1546336800,
  "event": "SET\_IN\_USE",
  "comment": "string",
  "asset": {
    "asset-id": "bike1",
    "place": {
      "coordinate": {
        "lng": 6.169639,
        "lat": 52.253279
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>

# Demo
To facilitate the adoption, we've added a demo: 

- Build the jar file in /target
- Now you can call demo.bat (Windows, 64bit machine) that will set up a MaaS provider, a bike TO and a car TO. <br>
- When running the script 'plan-and-book.bat' in the scripts directory (open first a cmd box), you'll see the interaction between the three boxes. The planning is fired from the cmd box to the MP box, it will interact with the TO boxes and will send the result to the cmd box. 
- After that, you can select a trip to book. <br> The booking will be done in 2 steps: adding bookings to the TO and after that a commit.
